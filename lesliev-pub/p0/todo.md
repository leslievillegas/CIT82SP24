- I think instead of white, I'll make the theme dark
- Kind of want to replace the background pictures with something but don't have images in mind atm
- Edit social buttons so they take visitors to the social media pages
- Edit favicon so it's not small and pixelated
- Add more information on the new pages
- One of the pages and sub pages will have a different colour scheme altogether so the theme will change for that (probably after the aasingment is done)
- English isn't my first language so I wanted to add a css translate feature but I think the web browser could already do that (after project is done)
- The about us page will be changed to showcase me and my friends information and favorite items from the game we play
- One of the pages(not sure which one yet) will have an add on that lets you generate different weapon kits for the game
